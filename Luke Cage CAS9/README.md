# Luke cage cas9 plasmid
Modifies keratinocytes to harden human skin via biomineralization 

Note: these plasmids are not suited to be fabricated and used in real life, i'd highly discourage trying to turn yourself or anything else into a super soldier, once again this is entirely theoretical and only for academic practice as I am extremely bored
